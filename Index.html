    <h3>Knight of the Silver Hand</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Troubles began to stir in Lordaeron. Orcs broke free of their internment camps, and there was distressing
            news of a plague that had gripped the northlands.</li>
        <li>
            Arthas and Uther were sent to Strahnbrad to defend the town from orcish raids. The young prince defeated the
            black drake Searinox to retrieve its heart for the
            dwarf Feranor Steeltoe to forge into an Orb of Fire.
        </li>
        <li>Arthas used this magical item to help defeat the orcs and kill the Blackrock clan blademaster leading the
            raids.</li>
